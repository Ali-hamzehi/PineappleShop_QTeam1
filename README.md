## 🗂️ Notion

To efficiently manage our project tasks, we utilized Notion, a collaborative workspace. It contains detailed project documentation, task lists, and progress tracking. "BitWiki" in our Notion, where we share our researches with each other.

## 🐳 Dockerization

Pineapple Shop has been Dockerized to simplify the deployment process. This containerization allows for consistent and reliable deployment across different environments.

## 🧪 Testing

We've incorporated a series of test cases for templates to ensure the project's stability and prevent regressions during development. These tests help maintain the quality of the user interface and ensure a smooth user experience.
